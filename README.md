#### A TS library for easy synthesis of QN patch files

## What can I use this for? / What advantages does it have over plain QN?
This library has a wide variety of use cases & advantages over plain QN(E).
For example:
- **On-the-fly SMF mod script synthesis** (especially useful when advanced mod options are finally implemented)
- Easier writing of **repeating & heavily logic-based** QN tasks
- **Just-in-time constants** for booleans, numbers and more
- Simple function calls for **commonly used entities** (like bools, numbers, timers, ...)
- Unbelievably simple parenting system
- Easier referencing with variables
- Includes typings for QN
- Familiar to anyone who knows QN or TypeScript

## Getting Started
To get started, install the package with ```npm i quickentity-script```. Then follow the steps in the [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md).
